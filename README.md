Bop Ballot is a song suggestion app that allows you to give song suggestions, vote on others' suggestions, and view the live voting.

>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features

- Login to keep your suggestions tied to your account

- Add votes to others' suggestions
- Play short previews of songs directly in the app
- View real-time updates on which songs have the most votes

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML pages for login, song search, suggestion list, and voting results
- **CSS** - Consistent and aesthetic color choice and styling throughout the app. Simple and straightforward user interface design.
- **React** - Uses login form, song search, voting, and displaying votes.
- **Service** - Backend service endpoints:
  - login
  - adding a song suggestion
  - submitting song votes
  - retrieving votes
  - Third-party call to iTunes Search API to get song data
- **DB/Login** - Store users, song suggestions, and song vote counts, user votes so that there isn't duplicate voting
- **WebSocket** - Every vote for a song updates the list in real time and broadcast to other users.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **HTML pages** - 4 html pages for login(index.html), making song suggestions(suggest.html), voting(vote.html), and voting results(scores.html).
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I used many HTML elements such as <head>, <nav>, <menu>, <li>, <a>, <form>, <label>, <input>, <table>, <img>, <span>, <button>, and more basic HTML elements.
- [x] **Links** - Each page has a menu at the top with links to direct you to any of the other pages. I also included a link in the footer of each page with my GitHub repo.
- [x] **Text** - Each page has text titles, there are labels for text entries and buttons, there are text descriptions for the song titles and artists and the results table has text entries.
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - I have a placeholder for the iTunes API on my suggest.html page and have a placeholder demonstrating sample results from the API.
- [x] **Images** - The song placeholders use images as album covers on the suggest.html and vote.html pages.
- [x] **Login placeholder** - There is a login placeholder on the homepage (index.html).
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - The table in scores.html represents where song suggestions and song vote numbers will be pulled and displayed from the database.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - The vote counts update automatically on scores.html when people click on the heart buttons on vote.html. The vote.html will update with new songs immediately after someone has used suggest.html to suggest a new song.
