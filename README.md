# Bop Ballot

[My Notes](notes.md)

Bop Ballot is a song suggestion app that allows you to give song suggestions, vote on others' suggestions, and view the live voting.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Tired of listening to the same music on repeat? Or frustrated when your music suggestions get ignored? With Bop Ballot, you can make song suggestions, vote on others' suggestions, and view the live voting results all in one place. It's the easiest way to share your favorite music, discover new songs, and create the ultimate crowd-approved playlist.

### Key features

- Login to keep your suggestions tied to your account
- Make song suggestions by searching for them using the iTunes Search API
- Add votes to others' suggestions
- Play short previews of songs directly in the app
- View real-time updates on which songs have the most votes

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML pages for login, song search, suggestion list, and voting results
- **CSS** - Consistent and aesthetic color choice and styling throughout the app. Simple and straightforward user interface design.
- **React** - Uses login form, song search, voting, and displaying votes.
- **Service** - Backend service endpoints:
  - login
  - adding a song suggestion
  - submitting song votes
  - retrieving votes
  - Third-party call to iTunes Search API to get song data
- **DB/Login** - Store users, song suggestions, and song vote counts, user votes so that there isn't duplicate voting
- **WebSocket** - Every vote for a song updates the list in real time and broadcast to other users.
